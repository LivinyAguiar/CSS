            <em>Laufey</em>
            <br>
            <p>
                Moved out to a new city<br>
                June is dawning down on me<br>
                And all that I can find<br>
                A sickly romance in the air<br>
                Lovers stroll without a care in sight<br>
                Ooh, this can't be right<br>
            </p>
            <span class="classA">
                'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky<br>
                And my best friend's found a new guy<br>
                I'm only getting older<br>
                I've never had a shoulder to cry on<br>
                Someone to call mine<br>
                Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind<br>
            </span><br>
            <p>
                Touched the ocean, fell right in<br>
                Stepped outside and burned my skin<br>
                My life won't go my way<br>
                Bossa nova in my room<br>
                Hope that I'll find someone too to love<br>
                Because<br>
            </p>
