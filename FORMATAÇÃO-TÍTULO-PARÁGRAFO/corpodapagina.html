                Don't you notice how<br>
                I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br>
                Me and you and awkward silence<br>
                Don't you dare look at me that way<br>
                I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, the burning pain<br>
                Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br>
                "She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah<br>
                Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br>
                Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                That when I talk to you oh, Cupid walks right through<br>
                And shoots an arrow through my heart<br>
                And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br>
                Confess I loved you from the start<br>
